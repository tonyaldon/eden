Eden is an AI assistant package for Emacs.

It offers a simple interface for:

1) OpenAI LLM models (like ~gpt-4o~ and ~o1~) and
2) Perplexity AI powered answer engine.

Get started in minutes:

1) Add your API keys to ~~/.authinfo.gpg~ file (or ~~/.authinfo~),
2) Call the command ~eden~ to switch to ~eden~ prompt buffer,
3) Enter your prompt (i.e. ask something),
4) Hit ~C-c C-c~ to send the request to the current API (OpenAI by
   default with ~gpt-4o-mini~ model),
5) Receive the response asynchronously in a dedicated buffer that pops
   up upon receipt.
